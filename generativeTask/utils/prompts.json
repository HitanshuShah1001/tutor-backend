Marks for a question indicate the complexity of the question. A question with higher marks should take more steps/time/complexity to solve.\n2. The solution for each question should follow a chain of thought with multiple steps. Do not skip any steps. Follow the NCERT Maths book for reference on how to provide chain of thought reasoning and granularity for steps. If confused, err on the side of providing one more step rather than one less step in the solution.\nImportant: Provide exactly as many questions as required in the blueprint i.e The number of questions in the blueprint should match the number of answers in your response",

Each document must be formatted neatly and structured as follows: Input JSON: The input JSON contains two types of questions: 'MCQ' and 'DESCRIPTIVE'. Each question includes relevant details such as options, correct answers, and explanations. Output Specifications: Document 1: Question Paper: Create an HTML document that contains all the questions. Format the document with clear headings: 'Section A: Multiple Choice Questions (MCQ)' and 'Section B: Descriptive Questions'. Further divide the sections into parts as follows: Part I (2 mark questions), Part II (3 mark questions), Part III (5 mark questions). Each part should contain questions grouped by their marks, with numbering in ascending order of marks. Part I should contain the lowest mark questions, Part II higher mark questions, etc. Each descriptive question in a specific part should be numbered in ascending order starting from 1. For MCQs: Display the question text and options (A, B, C, D) in a clean layout. Do not include the correct answer or explanation in this document. For Descriptive questions: Display only the question text. Do not include the answer or explanation. Include appropriate styling for readability (e.g., headings, spacing, and numbered questions). Document 2: Answer Sheet: Create an HTML document that contains the answers for all questions from both sections. Format the document with clear headings: 'Section A: Multiple Choice Questions (MCQ)' and 'Section B: Descriptive Questions'. For MCQs: Display the question number and the correct answer (e.g., '1. B'). Include the explanation for each correct answer. For Descriptive questions: Display the question text, the question number, the full answer, and the explanation. Use styling for clarity (e.g., bold question numbers, indent explanations)."

Generate a clean and well-structured HTML representation of the *solution sheet* for these questions.\n2. For each question, you must include:\n   - The original question text.\n   - The difficulty (EASY, MEDIUM, or HARD).\n   - The topic of the question.\n   - The marks assigned.\n   - The correct answer. If it is an MCQ, specify the correct option (e.g., 'Answer: C'). If Descriptive, simply provide the final answer.\n   - The chain of thought steps (calculationSteps), each explained. Show the 'equation' and 'chainOfThoughtExplanation' in an organized manner.\n3. Provide consistent HTML with the following guidelines:\n   - Use <html> and <body> tags.\n   - Use headings <h1> or <h2> for the overall 'Solution Sheet' and subheadings for each question.\n   - Each question should appear in a <div> or <section>.\n   - Format the chainOfThoughtExplanation and equation in a visually clear way, e.g., a list or separate <p>.\n\nOutput ONLY the HTML, nothing else. Do not output JSON. Return a single HTML string that can be used as a solution sheet."
